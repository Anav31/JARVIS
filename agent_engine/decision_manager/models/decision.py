Description:
-------------
Defines the unified decision result returned by the Decision Manager.

DecisionAction is intentionally separate from ExecutionStatus.

The Decision Manager decides what should happen next.
The State Manager / Orchestrator will later apply that decision.

Phase D:
    D-1 - Retry Policy
    D-2 - Timeout Handling
    D-3 - Failure Strategy
    D-4 - Skip Policy
    D-5 - Fallback / Recovery
    D-6 - Unified DecisionResult
